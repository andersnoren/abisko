# Gatewood

Gatewood is a minimal theme for blogs and personal websites. It features a sticky sidebar menu on desktop for quick and easy navigation, and the clean design puts your content front and center. Gatewood comes with seven different theme styles to choose from, and over 15 different block patterns that you can use to quickly build unique page layouts.

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
